'Sports & Outdoors', 'Sports Water Bottles', 'Accessories' Sports & Outdoors 338400.0. Keep yourself hydrated with the reusable Klean Kanteen stainless steel water bottle, which now comes in a variety of colors. Klean Kanteens are made from #304 stainless steel, the material of choice in the food processing, dairy, and brewery industries. Stainless steel is easy to clean, durable, inert, sanitary, toxin-free, and non-leaching. It's also toxin- and BPA-free and 100 percent recyclable in most areas. Klean Kanteen bottles do not have a chemical lining like some other metal bottles, and they won't ever leach a chemical taste into your drinks. The large-mouth design makes it easy to pour in ice cubes or a smoothie packed with frozen strawberries. It's also easy to clean--just scrub it out with white vinegar and baking soda (or mild soap and water), or load it in the dishwasher. It's topped by a polypropylene looped cap that makes it easy to grab on the go. All Klean Kanteens are backed by a 1-year manufacturer's warranty. Klean Kanteen bottles come in several sizes: Capacity: 18 ounces (532 ml) Weight: 6 ounces Size: 7 x 2.75 inches (HxW, without cap) Opening diameter: 1.75 inches Grown-ups love the 18 ounce bottle for its compact, easy-to-carry, lightweight size that slips into bags, cup-holders, and even the water bottle cage on your bike. \",\n",

Based on the Ashtanga practice,Yoga with Richard Freemandemonstrates successive and continuously flowing poses in the traditional method. Freeman instructs this two-hour video with great emphasis on the sequential arrangement of each posture. Movement, body alignment, and deep full breathing become the focus throughout each series. These elements (breathing, movement, and alignment) aid in pulling from the core energy. Freeman explains that the breath not only generates liveliness, but it acts as the link between mind and body. The constant movement within this program creates an extensive challenge for the major muscles of the upper and lower body and will make even the most conditioned yoga practitioner break a sweat. These poses are difficult and require substantial flexibility and strength, however alternative postures are offered for exercisers in need of modifications or introductory level exercise. Seasoned practitioners will find a great workout here, while beginners may find this method somewhat unapproachable at first. As with any exercise program, stamina and flexibility will increase as the frequency of training becomes greater. Listening closely to Freeman's enlightening tips on the distinct practice of Ashtanga will only heighten the overall experience. Authentic yoga terminology is used here, which makes this workout informative and effective.Yoga with Richard Freemanis a fantastic format that will continue to test the agility and strength of all yoga participants.

Vinyasa Unlocked Vinyasa Unlocked is a special series of Yoga workshops designed to help you learn and practice ways to improve Suryanamaskara through to Viparita Chakrasana by adding grace and power. The guiding principal is to balance flexibility and strength throughout the body. If we can develop both at the same time our stability and grace with all Vinyasa will be improved. More importantly we will be well on the way to spiritual wholeness. Just as we aim to balance the inhalation and exhalation in our practice, the masculine and feminine and the Sun and Moon, it is essential that we seek to balance these qualities at the most basic level of the body. If you can develop your strength and flexibility equally, you can also begin to balance these energies in the subtle body and deeply at your core. The first DVD in this set includes great details for developing:   the Salute to the Sun,   jumping through and jumping back,   headstand, forearm balance and handstand,   back bending and drop backs, and   the reverse wheel or tic-tacs. The second DVD includes a range of supporting exercises on:   core strength,   shoulder and upper back flexibility,   leg strength and front body flexibility,   variations on all the Salutes, and   Nauli Kriya and the three Bandha.

INTERWOVEN LEATHER GRIP LEATHER COVERED WOOD SCABBARD The importance Vikings placed on their swords is well documented. One of the important works on the subject, \"The Sword in Anglo Saxon England\" by H.R. Ellis Davidson links the central role the Viking sword played in the daily activities of the Norsemen. Such activities included, but were not limited to, warfare, attainment of manhood, and the last funeral rites. The warrior culture of the Vikings did in no way undermine their artistic creativity. Quite the opposite, the artistic genius and cultural achievements of the people are clearly reflected in their swords, jewelry and other Viking weapons. The literary sources of the Norsemen, such as their sagas and poems, reveal of the quality of a good sword and its significance in Viking society. With this in mind, our goal was to forge a Viking sword which reflects their spirit and embraces the cultural achievements attained by the Viking people.

Billed as the \"future of fitness\" and hawked by numerous celebrities, Billy Blanks\\'s Tae-Bo actually deserves much of the hype it\\'s receiving. A mixture of boxing punches and martial arts kicks, Tae-Bo is funandeasy. One of the best elements of this four-tape set is that the first tape (which is 40 minutes long),Tae-Bo: Instructional, lays out the movements you need to successfully complete a workout. Once you\\'ve mastered the steps, you won\\'t have to fast-forward through half the tape to get to the workout, nor will your workout be slowed down by the repeated lessons. After you feel comfortable with the movements (and they\\'re really quite easy to follow; nothing too complicated to trip you up), you\\'re ready to move on toTae-Bo: Basics, a 27-minute workout (5 minutes of warm-up, 18 minutes of Tae-Bo, and 4 minutes of cool-down) that will have your heart pounding and your body sweating. Next comesAdvanced, a 57-minute workout that will have your heart racing, pulse pounding, and sweat glands working overtime. There\\'s razzmatazz on the moves, with slightly more complicated combinations that should be fairly easy to master if you\\'ve completed the first two tapes. This video seriously raises the bar on the difficulty factor.In addition to the short warm-up, the cool-down, and the 30 minutes of Tae-Bo,Advanced Tae-Boalso includes 18 minutes of muscle-crunching floor work. You know you\\'re in trouble when even the guys in the tape have trouble keeping up. Make sure you have truly mastered the first two tapes before attempting this one. The8-Minute Workoutis a highly compacted workout (actually 14 minutes long when you include warm-up and cool-down) for those days when you\\'re too short on time forBasicorAdvanced. While the 8-minute idea is compelling, it\\'s not an adequate substitute for the longer workouts. Blanks, a seven-time World Martial Arts champion, is a superb instructor, providing encouragement and careful instruction (if you don\\'t know by the end of the tape to hold in your stomach, that\\'s no one\\'s fault but your own). The only downside to these tapes is the less-than-exciting music. Not only is Tae-Bo great exercise for all levels, but the punches and kicks are wonderful for working out stress and aggression.

Admirers of the game, let alone Tennessee Titans fans, will be disappointed that three-quarters of the tape's 60 minutes is a yearbook of the Rams' startling turnaround from NFL doormats to champions. The game-by-game recap of the Rams' season is punctuated by player interviews, on-field talk, and the enthusiastic calls of the play-by-play announcers. The NFL Films formula of slick editing, grandstanding music, and the velvet tones of narrator Harry Kalas makes one relive the terrific Super Bowl with the emotional sting intact.

One of the group\\'s better albums, despite coming so late in their history that it was ignored by almost everyone. \"Hope,\" \"Fire Brothers,\" and \"Don\\'t Cry for My Lady Love\" are among the best songs the group ever cut, and \"I Found Love\" is one of the prettiest, most upbeat songs ever to come from any classic San Francisco band. Some of the rest is self-indulgent, but that\\'s what this era of music was about -- the guitar pyrotechnics of \"Song for Frisco\" and \"Play My Guitar\" make them both more entertaining than their somewhat bland melodies; the latter song, in particular, sounds like a Marty Balin/Jefferson Airplane outtake that would have been right on target about four years before the release date of this album. The whole record feels that way, a throwback to the psychedelic era circa late 1967. It\\'s also very much a folk-rock record, with a rich acoustic guitar texture on many of the songs. For the record, since the CD reissue has no personnel information, the band at this point was Dino Valenti (guitar, vocals), Greg Elmore (drums), Gary Duncan (vocals, guitar), Mark Ryan (bass), Mark Naftalin (keyboards), and Chuck Steaks (keyboards). If you ever wondered what the Airplane might have done as a follow-up to Surrealistic Pillow with Marty Balin still singing lead, this is it. ~ Bruce Eder, All Music Guide ',\n",

Ginkgo Garden is also named \"living fossil\" It is a unique phenomenon in the plant world and myths as well as tales have been created about it, inspiring Eddy F. Mueller to use the theme ginkgo for his music.\"Garden\" stands for a musical garden in which Eddy has planted his complex instrumental titles to let them flourish in a symbiotic way and in order to sensitize the listener\\'s senses. At the same time Eddy has adopted William Shakespeare\\'s motto: \" I want to touch the people\\'s hearts\".The first Ginkgo Garden album was entitled \"Leaves of Hope (1993) and a year after the release of the first album Eddy could not put down his thoughts of the fascinating theme of Ginkgo and its varied symbolism. It was not to be long until Eddy continued working on Ginkgo Garden, which had been intended to be a one-CD project only at the beginning. Inspired by a \"Secret Call\" Eddy F. Mueller wrote new instrumental titles and tried to do even more musical justice to the \"wonder tree\" Ginkgo as a symbol of the uniting of opposites (East/West; day/night; black/white; loud/low); nevertheless Eddy F.

Mel Torm \\'s \"Comin\\' Home Baby\" might seem like an odd choice in this company, its inclusion explained by its long-time status as a fave dance cut in English soul clubs. Some greater detail about the individual tracks in the liner notes would have been nice, but this is a fine investment for those who want soul as good as it is rare.

Lodge has been making cast-iron cookware for over 100 years, and thanks to cast iron's excellent durability, some of the original pans are probably still around. It's not hard to see why cast-iron pans are the ones most often passed down from generation to generation--nothing can dent, warp, or bend their heavy construction. This 9-inch griddle pan will meet all grilling needs without any decrease in quality as it ages. In fact, unlike many cooking surfaces, cast iron becomes more stick-resistant with use. Cast iron also has excellent heat retention, so dishes don't need to be cooked over extremely high temperatures. If you're concerned about nutrition, cast iron has been proven to safely add iron to food.

On stovetop or outdoor grill, this 10-ounce, cast-iron pot can be used to melt butter or cheese, to scald milk, and to warm syrup or basting sauce. Because cast iron is unmatched for heat retention and distribution, all of these tasks can be accomplished without fear of scorching. The pot is 4-1/2 inches in diameter by 2-1/2 inches deep. It weighs 3 pounds, must be seasoned with melted shortening and then baked, and needs to be coated with oil or cooking spray after each use to prevent rust. Cast iron's weight and care requirements put off some cooks, but, as has been known since the Middle Ages, cast iron permits precise baking and flavor-retentive cooking, has a natural nonstick finish when seasoned, and lasts for generations (thereby increasing its value). As it blackens with use, cast iron imparts to food a mystical aura of rustic nourishment and flavor.--Fred Brack \",\n",

Cast-iron pots have always been the perfect camping cookware, partly due to their heat retention (what other surface cooks so nicely over an open fire?), but also because they fit so nicely into Old West lore. We're all familiar with the classic image of cowboys sitting around the campfire as a cast-iron pot hangs over the coals and slow-cooks a rabbit stew. Now you can indulge your frontier fantasies with this Lodge 6-quart Dutch oven, which can fry, saut , grill, bake, or roast a host of meats, soups, and breads. The Dutch oven features a flanged lid, so you can place hot coals on the top for an extra heat source. The lid also flips over to serve as a griddle for pancakes or burgers. The oven includes built-in legs that sit comfortably on top of the campfire or in the fireplace, in addition to a hanging handle that hooks above the cooking surface. The oven measures 12 inches in diameter, is 3-3/4 inches deep, and weighs 20 pounds.Users are recommended to season the product before use according to the company's instructions (this prevents rust and delivers a permanent nonstick cooking surface). This Dutch oven isnotdishwasher-safe, so hand washing is recommended.--Rivers Janssen \",\n",

The Bushnell Yardage Pro 500 rangefinder quickly and accurately measures distances within 1 yard to help you hunt or to improve your golf game. Its compact and light design makes it a good accessory for many outdoor activities.All Bushnell Yardage Pro laser rangefinders models feature a scan mode for continuous target tracking and display distances using a multifunctional in-view LCD. All models are water and shock resistant and come with a one-year limited warranty.How a Laser Rangefinder WorksBushnell\\'s Yardage Pro rangefinders use an invisible, eye-safe Class 1 Laser beam (as classified by the FDA) which is \"bounced\" off distant objects with the press of a button. Then, the rangefinder\\'s high-speed digital clock measures the time it took for a laser beam to reach a target and return to the unit. Next, using advanced digital electronics, the rangefinder instantly calculates the distance within + /   1 yard and shows the range in either yards or meters on a through-the-lens LCD Display. The entire process is so fast that less than a second elapses between the time you press the button to generate a laser beam to the time the exact range to your target is displayed.Reflectivity of Target TypesBecause rangefinders \"bounce\" a laser beam off the target in order to take a measurement, their range is partially determined by the reflectivity of the target. In other words, hard or \"reflective\" targets   like a rock cliff or semi-truck   can be measured at greater distances than soft surface targets   like a deer. Ranges for moderately reflective targets, like trees, fall somewhere in the middle. Most experienced hunters will use their rangefinder to frequently estimate ranges to near and distant landmarks before they actually encounter a game animal. By \"pre-measuring\" ranges to spots where a trophy is likely to appear, they can concentrate on making an accurate shot when the moment of truth arrives.Through-the-lens LCD DisplayBushnell Yardage Pro rangefinders are fast and easy to use because everything you need to know is displayed on our built-in, through-the-lens LCD (Liquid Crystal Display). Here\\'s how it works:A. Targeting ModesScanThe Scan mode allows you to pan across the landscape while viewing a continuously updated LCD display of the distances between you and the targets you scan with the viewfinder.RainThis feature compensates for precipitation to guarantee an accurate distance measurement through rain or snow.ZipZip allows you to accurately measure longer ranges (beyond 150 yards) when looking through foreground clutter like brush or branches.ReflectorThis feature increases the maximum measurement range for most highly reflective objects.B. Meters/YardsYou can quickly choose between these standard measuring units with a simple press of a button.C. ReticleThe distance to objects targeted in these crosshairs will be displayed on the Distance Readout with the press of a button.D. Battery IndictorFlashes when battery power is low.E.

'Sports & Outdoors', 'Basketball', 'Team Sports', 'Basketball Hoops & Goals', 'Court Equipment', 'Portable' Sports & Outdoors 11131.0. Fun for the entire family, this portable basketball system can go anywhere you want to shoot hoops. This system features a 44-inch backboard, three pieces of 3-inch round black telescoping pole sections, a black classic rim, and a 27 gallon portable base. The backboard is constructed of high-density polyethylene, making it durable and rugged to withstand the elements. The rim features a 5/8-inch solid steel ring and is supported by 1/2-inch braces; the all-weather nylon net is long-lasting. The telescoping pole adjusts the rim height from 7.5 to 10 feet in 6-inch increments without the use of tools. To stabilize the base, a 27-gallon capacity (about 234 pounds of water or 364 pounds of sand) allow for a stable foundation.Portable basketball systems depend on a base filled with sand or water for stability. Although it will take up more space than an in-ground system, the portable base rolls on wheels, allowing players to position the basketball system in the desired location (and also allowing storage in a garage). Simply assemble, fill the base, and star shooting some hoops. There is no fussing with concrete.Amazon.com Basketball System Buying GuideWith the high-quality construction of many portable basketball systems, turning your driveway into a basketball court can be as simple as hooking up your garden hose. But while a portable system may ultimately be your best choice, there are reasons you may want to consider an in-ground or wall-mount system before you decide.In-Ground SystemsIn-ground systemsare permanently cemented into the ground--either via a bolt mounting kit or directly into the ground--and are generally more rigid and take up less space than portables. In-ground systems often require that you hire a professional to complete the task, but when the cement dries you'll have a hoop that can take punishing dunks with ease.Many in-ground systems are height-adjustable, include removable post features that let you take the system down for off-season storage, and feature heavy-duty break-away rims. You'll also want to research the adjustable mechanisms on the systems, as there are several types to choose from. Some feature a counter-balance spring that lets you perform easy, one-hand adjustments while others may feature a sturdy, pneumatic system.Wall-Mount SystemsWall-mount systemscan be mounted to the side of a house, a tall retaining wall, or a garage. Generally sturdier than portables, wall-mounts have the added advantage of optimizing your existing ground space for the court, since you won't take any space up with the base or pole. Not all systems include the necessary hardware, so make certain you add a mounting kit to your list.Portable SystemsPortable systemsrequire minimal installation and offer ultimate convenience. These systems generally feature a base that can be filled with sand or water to stabilize them and include wheels for portability. Although they are not as sturdy as in-ground or wall-mounted hoops, portables are simple to set up and can often be folded for convenient storage.Backboard ConsiderationsRegardless of which system you choose, you'll want to brush up on Backboards 101. Most residential systems feature backboards made of acrylic, fiberglass, graphite, or various other composite materials. While clear acrylic gives the professional look and feel of glass, it is not as rigid as fiberglass or graphite. Some systems may offer steel or aluminum backboards, which are virtually vandal resistant, but don't offer the true rebounding action.The regulation size of an NBA backboard is 72 inches wide and 42 inches high. Most portable hoops are 42 or 44 inches wide and 36 inches tall. In-ground systems tend to be a bit larger, with 54-inch and 60-inch widths being the most popular. While rectangular shaped backboards provide more bank shot opportunities, they are generally more expensive than the streamlined fan-shaped board. \",\n",

Big, simple, and strong--especially strong--are the three words that define this tricycle. Its all-metal construction makes it several times the weight of many competitors, but how many of them have a warranty that reads \"Ten years or 10,000 miles\"? This brute has monster-sized inflatable tires (10 inches in diameter by 3.5 inches wide at the back, and 15 inches by almost 4 inches at the front). The frame looks strong enough to ride through a brick wall, and the seat--also metal, and not exactly built for comfort--adjusts infinitely along the sloped main frame. A simple hole-and-pin hitch at the back is perfect for towing. Adult assembly is required.--Richard Farr ',\n",

Gadfly Records is proud to announce the release ofHarry's Gone Fishingfrom British folk legend Leon Rosselson.Harry's Gone Fishingis the first release of new songs for Rosselson since the early '90s. In addition to the always-witty and observant stylings of Rosselson, the release features guest appearances from the cream of the English folk scene: Martin Carthy, John Kirkpatrick, Fiz Shapur, and others.Rosselson has been an active and noted member of the British folk scene for almost 40 years. He began writing songs seriously (and humorously) in the early 1960s and hasn't stopped yet! His early songs were topical-satirical (some of them were featured on TV's satire showThat Was The Week That Was) but he broadened out from there, absorbing different influences and experimenting with different song forms. His songThe World Turned Upside Downhas been recorded and popularized by, among others, Dick Gaughan and Billy Bragg (who took it into the U. K. pop charts in 1985) and has been sung on numerous demonstrations in Britain and the U.S. HisBallad of a Spycatcher, ridiculing the U.K. ban on Peter Wright's book, went into the U.K. Indie Singles charts in 1987 in a version backed by Billy Bragg and the Oyster Band. Rosselson has performed in every conceivable venue in North America, the U.K., Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, and Australia. He toured North America in October 2000 to coincide with the release ofHarry's Gone Fishing. \",\n",

The compact Precision Navigation Corsa X441 digital compass fits nicely in the palm of your hand and is a great tool for hikes or orienteering adventures. It's also a great addition to your GPS unit, since it will provide directional information when you're in places that make GPS signals go fuzzy, like by trees or tall buildings, or if you're in a canyon.The Corsa X441 features three modes--basic compass, clock, and timer. Switching between modes and making settings changes are performed via the Corsa X441's two buttons--the device's only controls. It will return to clock mode when the compass mode times out, which is set at a default 5 minutes. You can change the settings to up to 90 minutes, or turn off this feature so that it never times out.Before using the Corsa X441 for the first time, you'll need to calibrate it. Calibration allows the device to separate the earth's magnetic field from the magnetic fields generated by external influences, such as gear you may be carrying, and thereby provide accurate heading information. Calibrating is a rather simple procedure, requiring you to slowly turn yourself around twice as you hold the compass.You can choose from two compass rose arrow orientations: directional arrow and north-pointing arrow. The directional arrow points to the direction you are heading, while the north-pointing arrow will always point to the north as on a mechanical compass. (With both orientations, North is always at the top of the display.) A magnetic distortion flag will alert you should any external magnetic interference compromise the compass heading accuracy.The timer has very basic functionality, featuring pause and restart from the pause point, reset to zero, and a maximum measurement of 99 hours, 59 minutes, and 59 seconds.The Corsa X441 is a rugged device; it's able to sustain drops to the ground and is resistant to water up to 10 feet deep. It also features ruler markings on its back (both inches and centimeters) for measuring map distances, and an average 500-hour battery life using one lithium battery. To change the battery, you'll need to remove the back with a small Phillips screwdriver.It comes with a one-year limited warranty and includes the lithium battery installed in the device. \",\n",

Perfect for use on the golf range, out in the field, or on a lake, theBushnell Yardage Pro 600 Laser Rangefinder is a lightweight andcompact 4x monocular that accurately measures distances from 21 to 600yards away. The rangefinder is made of durable black plastic with arubberized gripping area, making it easy to hold. To measure adistance, simply put one eye up to the monocular, aim at a target,press and release the fire button on top of the instrument, and waitfor the reading to be displayed inside on the LCD. Your target must beat least 21 yards away or you will get no reading.There are five different targeting modes easily set by pressing a modebutton also located on top of the rangefinder. The five modes are: 1)standard, for normal conditions; 2) scan, for moving targets; 3)reflective, for highly reflective targets; 4) rain, for readingsduring inclement weather; and 5) zip thru, exclusively for targetsmore than 115 yards away. Most of the time you will probably just wantto use the standard setting.Infrared energy pulses are emitted from the Yardage Pro 600 when thefire button is pressed. A high-speed clock measures the time it takesthe energy pulses to travel from the rangefinder to the target andback. Using this information, sophisticated circuitry inside the unitinstantaneously calculates the distance to the target. The infraredenergy pulses are eye safe. The color, surface finish, size and shapeof the target all effect reflectivity and range. Brighter colors likered or shinier surfaces on targets allow for a greater range. Lightingconditions and angle to the target can also effect the range.The Yardage Pro 600 can be set to measure distances in yards ormeters. The internal display gives you the distance measurement,indicates when the battery is low, and even rates the quality orreflective level of the target, which helps you decide whetherto switch targeting modes. It uses a 9-volt alkaline battery (notincluded). A sporty, form-fitting neoprene case with a shoulder strapis included in the box. \",\n",

Every kitchen needs a cast-iron skillet like this, if only to properly brown meats. It\\'s perfect for just about any frying chore and goes into the oven as a roasting pan and even as a baking pan. (It\\'s the traditional \"skillet\" in skillet corn bread.) Because cast iron is unexcelled for retaining heat and distributing it evenly--no hot spots--foods cook uniformly in the 8-inch skillet. It\\'s heavy, must be seasoned with melted shortening and baked, and needs to be coated with oil or cooking spray after each use to prevent rust. Though its weight and care put off some cooks, cast iron--as has been known since the Middle Ages--permits precise cooking and flavor retention, is naturally nonstick when seasoned, and lasts for generations, increasing the value of its moderate price. As it blackens with use, cast iron imparts to food a mystical aura of rustic nourishment and flavor.--Fred Brack ',\n",

The pocket-sized Pro Scout is water resistant and comes with a standard 3-volt battery.How a Laser Rangefinder WorksBushnell\\'s Yardage Pro rangefinders use an invisible, eye-safe Class 1 Laser beam (as classified by the FDA) which is \"bounced\" off distant objects with the press of a button. Then, the rangefinder\\'s high-speed digital clock measures the time it took for a laser beam to reach a target and return to the unit. Next, using advanced digital electronics, the rangefinder instantly calculates the distance within + /   1 yard and shows the range in either yards or meters on a through-the-lens LCD Display. The entire process is so fast that less than a second elapses between the time you press the button to generate a laser beam to the time the exact range to your target is displayed.Reflectivity of Target TypesBecause rangefinders \"bounce\" a laser beam off the target in order to take a measurement, their range is partially determined by the reflectivity of the target. In other words, hard or \"reflective\" targets   like a rock cliff or semi-truck   can be measured at greater distances than soft surface targets   like a deer. Ranges for moderately reflective targets, like trees, fall somewhere in the middle. Most experienced hunters will use their rangefinder to frequently estimate ranges to near and distant landmarks before they actually encounter a game animal. By \"pre-measuring\" ranges to spots where a trophy is likely to appear, they can concentrate on making an accurate shot when the moment of truth arrives.Through-the-lens LCD DisplayBushnell Yardage Pro rangefinders are fast and easy to use because everything you need to know is displayed on our built-in, through-the-lens LCD (Liquid Crystal Display).

The company began when MacRae Hosiery manufacturers, established by Alexander in 1914, extended the manufacture of underwear to swimwear and became MacRae Knitting Mills. A naming competition was held by the staff in 1928 and won by a Captain Parsonson, who coined the slogan, \"Speed on in your Speedos.\" In 1929, the first swimsuits were in production and it didn t take long for Speedo to successfully establish itself. World War II caused the brand turn over 90% of it s manufacturing to war production, providing the armed services with vital equipment such as mosquito nets. After the war, Speedo opened a new factory and was able to re-establish itself, due to increased demand for swimsuits. In 1951, Speedo Knitting Mills (Holdings) Ltd, was incorporated and became a publicly traded company on the Sydney Stock exchange.Speedo hit the international stage in earnest, at the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games, and a few years later the brand grew on a more global scale. Export sales to the USA began and an international division was set up to monitor trade in New Zealand, Japan and South Africa. The expansion of the brand continued, and in 1976, Speedo was appointed as the official swimwear for the 1976 Montreal Olympics, where 52 out of 54 countries wore their swimsuits.Speedo continues to make its mark in the pool and on the beach today.

Straight-edge knives should go through both stages, while serrated blades should only be used in the polishing stage.The internal elastomeric spring guides hold knife blades at just the right angle to the sharpening surfaces, making sharpening easy. The instructions are easy to follow, and maintenance is limited to removing the metal dust shavings from the clean-out tray once a year or so; no lubrication is necessary for the motor, bearings, or sharpening surfaces.

'Sports & Outdoors', 'Electronics & Gadgets', 'Altimeters', 'Accessories' Sports & Outdoors 43041.0. Suunto's top-of-the-line wristop computer has everything a demanding diver could want. The Stinger has three separate diving modes with its own profile memory: regular air dive, enriched-air nitrox dive, and freediving/depth gauge with timer mode. In addition to having information available to you at all times, the Suunto Stinger records and stores data for later analysis. You can view, compare, and analyze your diving performance through a specially designed PC interface.The Stinger comes in three different versions: this one with a metallic band, one with anelastic strap, and one with atitanium housing.Suunto Stinger implements a Suunto-specific ceiling and floor feature. The decompression floor is the deepest point at which the ascent time will not increase. The decompression ceiling is the shallowest depth to which you should ascend. These depths provide the range where the diver utilizes the decompression stop most efficiently. Suunto Stinger uses the Suunto Reduced Gradient Bubble Model (RGBM) for decompression calculations.You can adjust the Suunto Stinger for diving at altitudes up to 3,000 meters (10,000 feet), and a personal level of conservatism can be added if desired. It enables you to set dive time and maximum depth alarms before your dive. The clear electro-luminescent backlight is activated automatically when dive alarms are given, making the dive parameters clearly visible and legible. The system is highly energy-efficient with only minimal power consumption. The built-in dive planning function helps you plan your next dive by showing you the no-decompression time data for different depths.In the Nitrox mode, you can program Suunto Stinger for nitrox mixtures of 21 to 50-percent oxygen in 1-percent increments. You can also adjust it for oxygen partial pressure from 1.2 bar to 1.6 bar in 0.1-unit increments. Suunto Stinger gives both visual and audible alarms when the limit for oxygen partial pressure, CNS or OTU values are exceeded.For freediving enthusiasts, Suunto Stinger introduces a 1-second precision timer with selectable 2, 4, 10, 20, 30 or 60-second profile memory-sampling rates. After 5 minutes of continuous diving in the Free mode, it automatically switches to Gauge mode. In both the Free and Gauge mode you can use a run-time timer. This makes Suunto Stinger also ideal for technical and military diving.The triple o-ring pushbuttons and its monocase design without a separate rear cover make Suunto Stinger virtually leakproof. The case has a pressure rating of 20 ATM (660 feet), so you can rely on the Stinger to work at the deepest depths.The Suunto Dive Manager (SDM) software that enables deeper understanding and better graphical representation of the data recorded and stored with Suunto Stinger. With SDM you can upload your dives to a PC and create a more detailed dive logbook. Here you can analyze and plan your sports activities and keep a training diary.Suunto Sports CommunityThe SuuntoSports.com Internet site enables you to share information with other cross-sport enthusiasts from around the world.

Long the authority on propane camping stoves, Coleman steps up to the plate again with its two-burner PerfectFlow stove. Coleman\\'s PerfectFlow appliances regulate the pressure of the propane to provide a consistent cooking performance without flaring or flickering. This steady fuel stream holds true even in cold weather, high altitudes, or when the fuel is low.This Coleman propane stove sports 2 independently adjustable 10,000 BTU burners.The stove is equipped with two 10,000 BTU burners, with independently adjustable flames that let you boil water on high (in a mere 4-1/2 minutes) while you simmer chili on low. The fuel is long lasting as well: with just a single propane fuel cylinder (sold separately), you can use both burners on high for up to an hour--more than enough time to prepare a weekend\\'s worth of meals. Plus, the stove includes Coleman\\'s Windblock side panels, which not only shields the burners for maximum heat, but also adjusts outward to accommodate larger pot sizes. Propane stoves are perfect for almost any social outdoor activity, including camping, hunting, tailgating, and backyard cookouts. The PerfectFlow stove measures 23.25 by 5.5 by 14.75 inches (W x H x D) when closed and carries a three-year warranty.About ColemanMore than 100 years ago, a young man with an entrepreneurial spirit and a better idea began manufacturing lanterns in Wichita, Kansas. His name was W.C. Coleman, and the company he founded would change life in America. A man plagued with such poor vision he sometimes had to ask classmates to read aloud to him, Coleman saw a brilliant light in 1900 in a drugstore window that stopped him in his tracks. He inquired about the light inside and discovered he was able to read even the small print on a medicine bottle by the illumination. The lamps had mantles, not wicks, and were fueled by gasoline under pressure instead of coal oil. Soon afterward, Coleman started a lighting service that offered a \"no light, no pay\" clause--a big step forward for merchants who were burned by inferior products that rarely worked--and drew substantial interest from businesses that wanted to keep their lights on after dark.In the ensuing years, Coleman expanded its product line well beyond lanterns. The company\\'s current catalog is thick with products that make spending time outdoors a pleasure. There are coolers that keep food and drinks cold for days on end, comfortable airbeds that won\\'t deflate during the night, a complete line of LED lights that last for years, powerful portable grills that cook with an authentic open-grill flame, and much, much more. Coleman has truly fashioned much of our outdoor camping experience, and expects to do so for generations to come. ',\n",

Renown internationally as a manufacturer of boxing equipment, Everlast started out as a swimwear manufacturer in 1910. Headquartered in the Bronx, NY, the company was founded by 17-year-old Jacob Golomb. The son of a tailor and an avid swimmer, Jacob Golomb was dissatisfied with the durability of swimsuits because they barely lasted a season, so he began making suits that he guaranteed would last for a full year. He proudly gave them the name,Everlast. Although the swimsuits did not last through the years, the name did.Over the next years, Golomb expanded his company into a small retail store that carried a full line of sports equipment. In 1917, a young fighter named Jack Dempsey introduced boxing to Golomb and Everlast. Dempsey asked Golomb to construct protective headgear that would last more than 15 rounds of intensive boxing training. Golomb specially designed the training gear for Dempsey. In 1919, Dempsey won the world s heavyweight championship wearing boxing gloves made for him by Golomb. Everlast became the headquarters for boxing equipment throughout the world. In 1925, Golomb designed elastic-waist trunks to replace the leather-belted trunks then worn by boxers. These trunks, now known as boxer trunks, immediately became famous. Jacob Golomb ran the business until he passed away in the early 1950 s and his son, Dan, took over. In 1958, Ben Nadorf joined Everlast and purchased 50% of the company from the Golomb family. When Dan Golomb passed away in 1995, Nadorf purchased the family s remaining 50% interest. Nadorf remained the President and Principle Share Holder of Everlast until October 24, 2000.Everlast men s and women s apparel and accessories continue today to be tremendously successful both inside and outside the ring. In addition, Everlast boxing trunks and equipment remain the proud and undefeated champion of the boxing industry for more than 90 years. The history continues, as the name states.

The collection opens with a swinging riff tune composed and arranged for Bunny Berigan and his Orchestra.\"Little Gate\\'s Special\". While this item is a typical swing era jump number, the first of the Artie Shaw recordings which follows illustrates a much more mature approach to swing music. \"Prelude In C Major\", the next selection, Ray\\'s original composition \"To A Broadway Rose\", by a similar size Shaw orchestra now well established with the listening and dancing public. \"Who\\'s Excited?\", an Artie Shaw song and Ray Conniff arrangement, the number is played with zest and a very strong ensemble sound. The romping \"Easy\" gets the James-Conniff first segment off to a flying start. \"Moten Swing\" is taken at a slower, mid tempo that is very effective. \"The Beaumont Ride\" evokes memories of a young Harry James. In this selection on this disc, we hear first \"Featuring The Boys\", Ray Conniff produced a most attractive arrangement for his original opus, \"The Lion And The Mouse\" by contrast \"Savage\" is a sultry piece. \"These Foolish Things\". Ollie Wilson\\'s fine toned trombone opens the piece which develops a gorgeous, warm mellow sound in which Artie\\'s clarinet is magical. \"Needlenose\", \"Jumping On The Merry Go Round\" is a lively rhythm tune with solos by Shaw, Dodo Marmarosa & Barney Kessel. Conniff produced another excellent original with \"Lucky Number\". Rounding out the Shaw-Conniff collaboration is \"Just Kiddin\\' Around\". The Kurt Weill standard \"September Song\" has attracted many performers through the years and in an instrumental vein, but none surpassed Ray\\'s brilliant conception for the James band book. The pace and mood of the arrangement is perfect and the superb melody is enhanced by the scoring and by the playing of the orchestra. Harry James liked to play the blues and his version of \"East Coast Blues\" arranged by Conniff this February 1947 cut is big band blues par excellence. James penned \"Friar Rock\" and with Ray\\'s assistance he wrote \"Redigal Jump\". \"The Last Mile\", a very attractive Conniff melody is the penultimate item in this collection and wraps up the James-Conniff sides neatly. Competing with \"September Song\" for the best Conniff arrangement is \"S\\'wonderful\"... Ray Conniff excelled himself with his inspired treatment of S\\'wonderful. For more than 45 years, the name of Ray Conniff has meant easy listening music at its very best. Launched in 1956, the unique blend of voices and instruments known as \\'The Conniff Sound\\' has been heard countless million-selling albums and in concert appearances world-wide. During the years of international fame, Conniff has drawn on his early career as a trombonist and arranger for the Big Bands. This collection features Conniff\\'s work as an arranger with several of the top orchestras of the 1930s and 40s. 23 tracks running over 73 minutes, 16 of which were also composed by him. ',\n",

The company began when MacRae Hosiery manufacturers, established by Alexander in 1914, extended the manufacture of underwear to swimwear and became MacRae Knitting Mills. A naming competition was held by the staff in 1928 and won by a Captain Parsonson, who coined the slogan, \"Speed on in your Speedos.\" In 1929, the first swimsuits were in production and it didn t take long for Speedo to successfully establish itself. World War II caused the brand turn over 90% of it s manufacturing to war production, providing the armed services with vital equipment such as mosquito nets. After the war, Speedo opened a new factory and was able to re-establish itself, due to increased demand for swimsuits. In 1951, Speedo Knitting Mills (Holdings) Ltd, was incorporated and became a publicly traded company on the Sydney Stock exchange.Speedo hit the international stage in earnest, at the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games, and a few years later the brand grew on a more global scale. Export sales to the USA began and an international division was set up to monitor trade in New Zealand, Japan and South Africa. The expansion of the brand continued, and in 1976, Speedo was appointed as the official swimwear for the 1976 Montreal Olympics, where 52 out of 54 countries wore their swimsuits.Speedo continues to make its mark in the pool and on the beach today.

When Sega decided to discontinue the Dreamcast, it opted to make its excellent sports titles available for other consoles. And not a moment too soon. Competition is always a good thing, and Sega Sports titles, includingNBA 2K2, are some of the best in the business.NBA 2K2features all the teams, rosters, and, most importantly, rule changes (like the now-legal zone defense) found in the real NBA. Player faces have been mapped to realistic body types (complete with tattoos), so you can identify a big man like Shaq and a speedster like Iverson without looking at their numbers. The game takes full advantage of the graphics-rendering power of advanced consoles by including better texturing, lighting effects, and facial animations, along with a higher polygon count, to ensure all the jukes, spins, jumps, and dunks are as realistic as possible. The audio is also good, particularly the play-by-play, which is accurate and speedy.The controls are intuitive--even for people used to the Dreamcast--especially in the area of on-the-fly play calling. The controls let you quickly and fluidly box out your opponent, spin, shoot, pass, fake, and dunk.There are also eight street-ball courts, and this addition makes for an almost entirely new game. In this respect, it is the equal of the NBA Live series from EA Sports. ButNBA 2K2surpasses EA's titles with its excellent AI. This game is challenging, satisfying, and fun in both single and multiplayer modes.--Bob AndrewsNote: This text refers to thePlayStation2 versionof this game.Pros:Gorgeous graphicsIntuitive controlsGreat AICons:A release date too long after the start of the NBA season \",\n",

Strat-O-Matic is the boss of sports board games, a memory-making experience. Ideal for playing solo or in friendship-bonding face-to-face play, Strat-O-Matic is easy to learn. Yet it is challenging enough to entertain for hours, as you make the player selections and the offensive and defensive decisions that decide the outcome. Make your lineup and in-game strategy decisions. Roll the dice that activate play (think of it as the pitch or swing). Then find the result on the statistically designed player card. Every player is unique, giving every dice roll drama. The first die tells you whether to consult the batter or pitcher card and which of his three columns to check. Two other six-sided dice are added to locate the result in the correct column. What a player does most (hit for average, hit for power, strike out, etc.) shows up on the most common dice combinations. Because of Strat-O-Matic s unmatched play value, a full nine innings can be played in less than 30 minutes. One dice roll ends most at-bats with the outcome right off the player card. Sometimes you ll need a dramatic second role   to find out if your fielder is good enough to save a run or turn a double-play, or to find out if that long fly ball is outta here or caught at the warning track. Three games in one, Strat-O-Matic will have you playing the Basic game within minutes of opening the box. Once you have a little experience, you may wish to adventure into the richly detailed Advanced and Super Advanced games, where lefty-righty advantages, ballpark effects, clutch hitting   and much more   practically put you in the dugout as a Major League manager. This revised edition of Strat-o-Matic Deluxe Baseball features six random mystery teams from the past, plus a coupon for 6 free teams from the most current season. \",\n",

Leonardo, in the always unusual world of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, is the leader of the crime fighting team that battles the evil Shredder. And while his leadership post may be credited to his charismatic personality and steely determination, credit must also be given to his enormous sword. This is a kid-size recreation of that weapon measuring about three feet long and made of plastic. It features no sharp edges making the injury risk more related to bonking than cutting. We had a hard time getting the compartment open to screw in the two AA batteries (not included) but once they're installed the sword makes a fun variety of swooshing and clanking sounds to accompany pretend battles. Apart from the Ninja Turtle logo on the handle, it's a pretty neutral sword and could probably fit in well in other pretend play scenarios (pirates, knights, Middle-earth). But it is still a sword and parents should be aware that it will always resemble a dangerous weapon. A blue Leonardo eye mask is also included.--Charlie Williams \",\n",

By simulating motions experienced through walking, stepping, cycling, and skiing, elliptical machines allow for a smooth and fluid motion while building strength in the arms and legs. Similar to the exercise position for treadmills, elliptical trainers are used by standing in an upright position while holding the handrails of the machine. With elliptical trainers, however, your feet remain in the foot pedals throughout the exercise regimen and circulate in a smooth and seamless motion, resulting in little to no impact on the knees, back, and hips.Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home.Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints. \",\n",

Standard features include fully multi-coated optics, an image correcting 45 degree prism, an 8x20 correct image finder scope, and high and low power eyepieces for 50X and 20X magnification.The 102mm Wide View scope is a uniquely flexible modular design. Most spotting scopes in this price range are limited to views only one or two degrees wide. Celestron s standard equipment 25mm low power eyepiece shows images 2.5 degrees wide. And when I use my own30mm Ultrascopiceyepiece I m treated to crystal clear images across a field of view more than 3 degrees wide.A wide sharp field of view makes it easier to follow moving targets. When I spotted a 'kettle' of migrating hawks it didn t take long to set the Wide View 102 on a tripod and follow the action. I was rewarded with a view that included a few eagles, and I was even able to snap some nice pictures.The 102mm Wide View Spotting Scope uses a 2 inch diameter rack and pinion focuser with an adapter for standard 1.25 inch eyepieces and a 'T' thread for camera use. That means the eyepieces can be upgraded at any time, with literally hundreds of options available. An easy upgrade for the Wide View 102 is Celestron s8 to 24mm Zoom Eyepiece. Telescope magnification is calculated by dividing the telescope focal length (500 mm) by the eyepiece focal length, so the 8-24mm zoom would magnify the image from 20.8X to 62.5X, an ideal range for wildlife spotting.The other option you ll need is a tripod. Celestron sPhoto and Video Tripodmay be sturdy enough for visual use with the Wide View 102 spotting scope, but I like theParagon HDheavy duty tripod from Orion because it s solid enough to serve as a base for photography as well.When I look at the night sky with the Wide View 102, the telescope offers delightful lower power views of the Milky Way Galaxy and open star clusters like the Pleiades. When I look at the Moon and planets at 100X, however, I can t help noticing the false color or blue fringing typical of a short focal length achromatic refractor. If your first love is astronomy, check out Celestron s Omni XLT 102 telescope. TheOmni XLT 102delivers clearer high power views of the Moon and planets because the longer focal length allows better color correction with an achromatic lens. --Jeff PhillipsPros:Delightfully sharp wide field imagesCompact and affordableAccepts 1.25-inch and 2-inch eyepiecesCons:Not waterproofBlue fringing noticeable at high power \",\n",

Today, Victorinox produces watches, luggage, clothing, and, famously, Swiss Army Knives. The original product dates to 1897, when Elsener patented the Swiss Officer\\'s and Sports Knife he supplied to the Swiss Army. Following World War II, American servicemen and women shopping in PX stores shortened the name to Swiss Army Knife, which lives on in English-speaking countries around the world and has become a metaphor for versatility.

Enter the Kettler Scooter Skiddy, which is recommended for children between the ages of 18 months and 4 years. Unlike most scooters, the Scooter Skiddy actually has two wheels in the rear rather than one, adding stability for the average tyke. At the same time, the scooter's heavy-duty footplate is both extra wide--the better to accommodate a young child's unsteady foot--and slip-resistant. The end result is a great scooter for developing a child's all-important balance and coordination. And cost-conscious parents will love the eight-position adjustable handlebar that grows with your child. Thanks to the handlebar, you won't need to give away the scooter just because little Sabine experienced a two-month growth spurt. And finally, the scooter includes a rear footbrake for slowing down.

Once you start opening the knife, SOG's Patented SOG Assisted Technology, or S.A.T., takes over. Through the balance of opposing high-tension coil springs in the knife, the force to propel the knife open becomes greater than the closing force, and the blade will open on its own. This unique feature means that if you are using your dominant hand on another task, you can just as easily open the FSA-98 with your other hand.For security and peace of mind, S.A.T. was developed in conjunction with a superior locking system. The unique design of S.A.T. knives allows them to use locking mechanisms that are stronger, more reliable, and easier to access ambidextrously than conventional liner locks.For Flash Series knives, this means the blade is held in place with a reliable piston lock that can be released quickly with a sliding button. An additional safety lock offers extra security when the blade is closed. For easy reference, the lock switch shows red when the knife is ready to open.Cryogenic Heat Treatment for Sharp, Dependable BladesOf course the workhorse of any knife is the cutting surface, and FSA-98 offers a full, 3.5-inch, half-serrated blade with an elegant satin finish.SOG's proprietary Cryogenic Heat Treatment process ensures that this blade will stay sharp over the long haul. This intensive process takes more than 48 hours and involves slowly bringing the blade's temperature down to less than -300 degrees Fahrenheit, then bringing it slowly back to room temperature. The stress created through this process relieves the material on an atomic level and increases overall strength and edge retention.Elegant, Ergonomic Design for Ease of UseEven if your blade is sharp, it's hard to make the cuts you want if a knife doesn't sit comfortably in your hand. That's why the handle on this knife features a unique, ergonomic contour. Crafted from tough, glass-reinforced Zytel, the handle helps ensure that your knife is both durable and well-balanced. And it is lightly textured to prevent slippage.At just 3.1 ounces, this folding knife is lightweight and easy to carry. A reversible, bayonet-mounted clip extends from the back of the handle, allowing the knife to sit low in your pocket for the most discreet carry possible.This knife is backed by a lifetime warranty that protects against defects in workmanship and materials.About SOG: Strong, Innovative, Specialty ToolsSOG originally stood for Studies and Observation Group, an elite joint services military group designed to handle covert operations during the Vietnam War.

Wholly original, the SlamMan offers everything you could ask for in a training partner: aerobic conditioning, major muscle toning, and terrific stress relief. The SlamMan's base and torso are made of thick, high-density, reinforced, blow-molded polyethylene that's comparable to the materials you find in the rough and tumble automotive field. In other words, it's built to stand up to heavy hits and hard abuse through the years. The top-quality molded foam striking surface, meanwhile, naturally absorbs blows, with 100 percent memory retention. No matter how many times or how hard he gets hit, the SlamMan will always return to his original shape without wrinkling or splitting.The SlamMan's training routine is simple: he offers eight illuminated LED targets that light up in various sequences, telling you where to punch. All you have to do is swing away. The SlamMan is also sensitive, with built-in sensors that adjust to your punch strength. Push the sensor down and you'll have to hit harder to activate the lights, creating a more vigorous boxing workout. And when you're ready to cool down, push the sensor the other way. And thanks to the 240 pounds of sand inside the SlamMan, you can hit him in the stomach as hard as you want.The SlamMan offers no shortage of workout options, with three skill levels (beginner, intermediate, and advanced) and five different boxing programs, creating up to 15 options in all. Plus, the computer not only scores and times your workout, but offers a random mode for boxers wanting a real challenge. In the end, there's no better way to naturally firm up and tone your muscles while improving your stamina, reflexes, and coordination. Other details include molded plastic lenses embedded beneath the foam to protect the LED lights, three adjustable heights (64, 68, and 72 inches), and a pair of professional 12-ounce boxing gloves.

Take your best shot with confidence with help from a Bushnell  Yardage Pro  laser rangefinder. Using advanced digital technology, Yardage Pro takes the guesswork out of measuring distances. Delivers superb range performance to targets from 5 to 1500 yards away at the touch of a button. The Bushnell Yardage Pro is accurate to within one yard even if you\\'re measuring in rain, snow or through foreground clutter like brush and branches. Measuring a mere 1.5x4x2.75 in. and weighing only 6.8 oz., the Yardage Pro Scout is the world\\'s smallest, most advanced laser rangefinder available.FeaturesCenter Wheel Focus SystemPorro Prism SystemMulti-coated LensBaK-4 Prism Glass340 ft @ 1000 yds Field of View4.5 mm Exit Pupil16 mm Eye ReliefWaterproofTripod AdaptableHow a Laser Rangefinder WorksBushnell\\'s Yardage Pro rangefinders use an invisible, eye-safe Class 1 Laser beam (as classified by the FDA) which is \"bounced\" off distant objects with the press of a button. Then, the rangefinder\\'s high-speed digital clock measures the time it took for a laser beam to reach a target and return to the unit. Next, using advanced digital electronics, the rangefinder instantly calculates the distance within + /   1 yard and shows the range in either yards or meters on a through-the-lens LCD Display. The entire process is so fast that less than a second elapses between the time you press the button to generate a laser beam to the time the exact range to your target is displayed.Reflectivity of Target TypesBecause rangefinders \"bounce\" a laser beam off the target in order to take a measurement, their range is partially determined by the reflectivity of the target. In other words, hard or \"reflective\" targets   like a rock cliff or semi-truck   can be measured at greater distances than soft surface targets   like a deer. Ranges for moderately reflective targets, like trees, fall somewhere in the middle. Most experienced hunters will use their rangefinder to frequently estimate ranges to near and distant landmarks before they actually encounter a game animal. By \"pre-measuring\" ranges to spots where a trophy is likely to appear, they can concentrate on making an accurate shot when the moment of truth arrives.Through-the-lens LCD DisplayBushnell Yardage Pro rangefinders are fast and easy to use because everything you need to know is displayed on our built-in, through-the-lens LCD (Liquid Crystal Display). Here\\'s how it works:A. Targeting ModesScanThe Scan mode allows you to pan across the landscape while viewing a continuously updated LCD display of the distances between you and the targets you scan with the viewfinder.RainThis feature compensates for precipitation to guarantee an accurate distance measurement through rain or snow.ZipZip allows you to accurately measure longer ranges (beyond 150 yards) when looking through foreground clutter like brush or branches.ReflectorThis feature increases the maximum measurement range for most highly reflective objects.B. Meters/YardsYou can quickly choose between these standard measuring units with a simple press of a button.C. ReticleThe distance to objects targeted in these crosshairs will be displayed on the Distance Readout with the press of a button.D. Battery IndictorFlashes when battery power is low.E.
