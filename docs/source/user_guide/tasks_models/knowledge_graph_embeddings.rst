Knowledge Graph Embeddings Methods
---------------------------------
Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE) methods are designed to learn low-dimensional vector representations of entities and relations in a knowledge graph. These embeddings can be used for various tasks, including link prediction and recommendation.
